**FaceCrop** is a **Python** tool for face cropped videos. It allows you to infer face **region** and **landmarks** from **single person videos**. FaceCrop has been implemented with **batch inference** in mind allowing to treat the videos faster. It can be used to generate dataset for training Deep Learning models and such.
